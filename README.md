# Useful Python Snippets
In here you will be able to find useful coding snippets for Python

Some of these snippets are one-liners, I opted to use them as functions 
but you can definately use them in your code as they are.

A lot of these snippets are a combination of cool libraries that
make your code easier to maintain as these functions do not have a lot of moving parts and you can leave them to Python while you focus on more important features

## Some snippets include:
- Remove duplicates
- Check for code execution time
- List compression to smaller lists
- Matrix transpose
- Flatten nested lists
- And many more...
